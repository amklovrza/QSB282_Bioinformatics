## Some important literature

-   This reference brings important information about island-like environments and how we should look at them to estimate the diversity of marine lakes[@dawson_island_2016]

-   The reference [@hodapp_climate_2023] brings a background for the problems that the marine realm is facing, due to climate change. It will be a good start for my introduction!

-   Last, but not least, [@hackett_multi-habitat_2024] shows how multi-habitat landscapes can be more stable, and consequently less vulnerable to change.

## A cool equation of two
$$w_A(g) \equiv \prod_i^M \sum_j^M \Big( \frac{\exp(-q\epsilon d^H_{i,j})}{\sum_j \exp(-q\epsilon d^H_{i,j})} \Big) \phi^{d^A_{i,j}}$$
